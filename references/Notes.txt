About the Dataset

Update 06/08/2018 – The Melbourne housing market has cooled off. Key questions to explore:
1.	When did the slowdown start?
2.	What variables indicated the slowdown? Changes in price, unsold properties, rental shifts, or regional differences?
3.	Could it have been predicted?
4.	Should I wait before buying a two-bedroom apartment in Northcote?
Update 22/05/2018 – A refined version with fewer columns to improve processing.
Update 28/11/2017 – Clearance rates have started decreasing. Is this a pattern or just noise?
This dataset provides insights into Melbourne's housing market trends, including suburb pricing, regional variations, and historical transaction data.
