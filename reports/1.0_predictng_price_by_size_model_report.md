# House Price By Building Area Prediction Model Performance

## Based on the provided metrics:

Mean house price (price_usd): $752,859.19
Baseline MAE: $241,499.33
Testing MAE: $233,855.27

## Interpretation of Model Performance:

### **Baseline MAE**
The baseline MAE of $241,499.33 represents the average error if the mean house price is always
predicted for all properties.

### **Testing MAE**
The testing MAE of $233,855.27 represents the average error of the linear regression model on
the test set.

## Comparison and Conclusion:
The testing MAE ($233,855.27) is lower than the baseline MAE ($241,499.33). This indicates 
that the linear regression model is performing better than the baseline model, which simply
predicts the mean price for all properties.
Although the model is better than the baseline, the MAE is still quite high. This means that
while the model captures some of the relationship between 'BuildingArea' and 'Price_USD', there may
be other important factors influencing house prices that are not included in the model.

## Next Steps:

### To improve the model, the following steps will be considered:

**More Features**:
Including additional features that might influence house prices, such as the number of bedrooms,
suburbs, location, etc.
