# House Price By Suburb Prediction Model Performance
## Actual vs. Predicted Prices

This scatter plot compares the actual property prices with the prices predicted by the Random Forest model.

- The **red dashed diagonal line** represents perfect predictions: for any point on this line,
  the predicted price equals the actual price.
- The scatter of points around this line suggests that while some predictions closely match actual values,
  there is a notable degree of dispersion, particularly for higher prices. This indicates that while the modelbcaptures some trends in the data, it may not be fully accurate across all price ranges.

### Overall Insights
- Both visualizations indicate that the **Random Forest model** performs reasonably well, with residuals centered around zero.
- The scatter plot shows room for improvement, especially in predicting higher property prices,
  suggesting that further tuning or alternative modeling strategies could enhance performance.

### Follow-up Project
A follow-up project will aim to improve the model's accuracy by incorporating additional features
  such as **building area**, **location**, and **suburb** in an interactive dashboard, with the goal of better predicting property prices.
