# Beyond the Price Tag: House Price Prediction in Melbourne  

## **Project Overview**
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict house prices in **Melbourne**, Australia. Using **building area, latitude, longitude, and suburb**, we developed a predictive pipeline using **Ridge Regression** and **One-Hot Encoding**.  

Additionally, an **interactive widget** was deployed for **stakeholders and future use**, allowing users to input property details and get real-time price estimates.

## **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
- **Dataset**: Melbourne housing market dataset (cleaned and preprocessed).
- **Features Used**:
  - `Suburb` → Categorical, one-hot encoded.
  - `BuildingArea` → Numeric, representing the house's surface area.
  - `Latitude` & `Longitude` → Numeric, representing location.
- **Target Variable**: `Price_USD` (Converted from AUD using 2018 rates).

## **Model Pipeline**
The model pipeline consists of:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Using `DataTransformer` class.
2. **Feature Engineering**: One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
3. **Model Training**: `Ridge Regression` for improved generalization.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Baseline MAE**: $276,482.90
   - **Training MAE**: $157,843.17
   - **Testing MAE**: $159,148.28

## **Key Results**
- **Example Prediction:**
  ```python
  price_predictor(suburb="Fitzroy", area=120.5, latitude=-37.7981, longitude=144.9789)
